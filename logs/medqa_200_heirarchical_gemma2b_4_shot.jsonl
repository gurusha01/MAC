{"question": "Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin count 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,400/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 56%\nEosinophils 11%\nLymphocytes 31%\nMonocytes 2%\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 4.2 mg/dL\nRenal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\"Your options are: A: Renal papillary necrosis, B: Cholesterol embolization, C: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, D: Polyarteritis nodosa. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "B", "society_answer": "1. **The patient's symptoms:** Decreased urinary output, malaise, and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet.\n 2. **The patient's medical history:** Unstable angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis.\n 3. **The patient's recent procedure:** Emergency cardiac catheterization with stent placement.\n 4. **Laboratory findings:** Elevated creatinine, urea nitrogen, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n 5. **Renal biopsy findings:** Intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.\n\n**Considering all these factors, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is cholesterol embolization.**\n\n**Specialist:** Nephrologist\n\n\n**Explanation:** \n\n* **Cholesterol embolization** is a rare but serious complication of coronary artery procedures.

It occurs when cholesterol deposits from the plaque in the coronary arteries travel through the bloodstream and lodge in small blood vessels, leading to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.\n* The patient's symptoms (decreased urinary output, malaise, and mottled discoloration) are consistent with the effects of cholesterol embolization.\n* The patient's recent cardiac catheterization and medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol) increase the risk of cholesterol embolization.\n* The renal biopsy findings of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles are consistent with cholesterol emboli.\n\n**Note:** This is a complex case that requires the expertise of a nephrologist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a \u03b2-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen.

{"question": "A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?Your options are: A: Legionella pneumophila infection, B: Pneumocystis pneumonia, C: Histoplasma capsulatum infection, D: Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.

{"question": "A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, intermittent rigors, and night sweats. She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci.

{"question": "A 15-year-old woman presents with fever, altered mental status and a petechial rash on her lower extremities and back since yesterday evening. She also says she has been nauseous for the past 3 hours and has vomited twice. The patient mentions she has had heavy menstrual bleeding for the past few days. Her blood pressure is 95/80 mm Hg and her temperature is 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic. A pelvic examination reveals a tampon in her vagina. Binding and activation of which of the following T cell receptors is responsible for this patient\u2019s most likely condition?Your options are: A: B7 receptor, B: Variable \u03b2-sequence of the T cell receptor, C: CD3, D: IgCAM. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "B", "society_answer": "**1. Analyze the Questions:**\n    - The question asks for the most likely condition based on the patient's symptoms.\n    - The provided opinions from specialists are diverse and lack a clear consensus.\n    - The question requires a holistic approach to integrate the information from the specialists.\n\n**2. Identify Key Symptoms:**\n    - Fever\n    - Altered mental status\n    - Petechial rash\n    - Nausea\n    - Vomiting\n    - Heavy menstrual bleeding\n    - Foreign body in the vagina (tampon)\n\n**3. Consider Potential Conditions:**\n    - **Blood clotting disorders:** The patient's symptoms, including fever, altered mental status, petechial rash, and heavy menstrual bleeding, are suggestive of a blood clotting disorder.\n    - **Infections:** The presence of fever, nausea, vomiting, and heavy menstrual bleeding could indicate an infection.\n    - **Endocrine disorders:** The patient's age and symptoms could be related to an endocrine disorder.\n    - **Autoimmune disorders:** The patient's symptoms could be related to an autoimmune disorder.\n    - **Other possibilities:** The patient's symptoms could also be related to a variety of other conditions, including drug reactions, nutritional deficiencies, or psychological disorders.\n\n**4. Integrate Specialist Opinions:**\n    - The specialists' opinions are not consistent, and their focus is on different aspects of the patient's condition.\n    - The cardiologist's opinion is focused on blood clotting disorders.\n    - The endocrinologist's opinion is focused on endocrine disorders.\n    - The neurologist's opinion is focused on neurological disorders.\n    - The gynecologist's opinion is focused on reproductive health.\n\n**5. Prioritize the Most Likely Conditions:**\n    - **Blood clotting disorders:** The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a serious blood clotting disorder.\n    - **Infections:** The presence of fever, nausea, vomiting, and heavy menstrual bleeding could indicate an infection.\n    - **Endocrine disorders:** The patient's age and symptoms could be related to an endocrine disorder.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n    - The most likely condition is a serious blood clotting disorder, possibly related to a viral infection. \n    - The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based on the limited information provided.

{"question": "A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless \u201cblisters\u201d in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off.

{"question": "A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient\u2019s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient\u2019s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a \"clunk\" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine.

{"question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image).

{"question": "A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

{"question": "An 8-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Formation of which of the following is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?Your options are: A: Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells, B: Tissue-specific antibodies, C: Antigen-antibody complexes, D: Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "C", "society_answer": "1. The patient presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and edema, which are classic signs of glomerulonephritis.\n2. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer suggests a recent streptococcal infection, which is a common cause of glomerulonephritis.\n3. The patient's symptoms are consistent with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN).\n4. PSGN is an immune-mediated disease where antibodies against streptococcal antigens (antistreptolysin O) attack the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage.\n5. The most likely mechanism involved in this patient's symptoms is **C: Antigen-antibody complexes**. \n\n**Explanation:** The patient's symptoms are consistent with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), a type of glomerulonephritis caused by an immune response to a previous streptococcal infection. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer confirms the presence of an immune response. Antigen-antibody complexes are formed when antibodies bind to antigens, leading to their deposition in the glomeruli.
