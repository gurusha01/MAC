{"question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a \u03b2-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen.

{"question": "A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, intermittent rigors, and night sweats. She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was most likely treated with which of the following antibiotics?Your options are: A: Doxycycline, B: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, C: Linezolid, D: Chloramphenicol.

{"question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose.

The parents are unavailable, and the child's condition is deteriorating.  \n\nHere's why the best answer is **C: Perform emergency laparotomy**:\n\n* **Imminent Danger:** The child's symptoms (severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, distended abdomen, decreased bowel sounds) strongly suggest a serious condition like intestinal obstruction. Delaying surgery could lead to life-threatening complications like bowel perforation or sepsis.\n* **Best Interest of the Child:**  In emergency situations where parental consent cannot be obtained, medical professionals have a legal and ethical obligation to act in the best interest of the child.  Delaying potentially life-saving surgery would violate this principle.\n* **Legal Considerations:** Most jurisdictions have laws that allow for emergency medical treatment of minors without parental consent when the child's life or health is in immediate danger.\n\n**Who can help?**\n\nThis situation requires the expertise of a **pediatric surgeon** and likely a **pediatric intensivist** (for critical care management). \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncardiologist's Opinion:  \n The child is experiencing a serious medical emergency. The symptoms point to a bowel obstruction, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The x-ray confirms the suspicion. \n\nWhile parental consent is usually required, there are exceptions in emergency situations where a child's life is at risk.  The child's condition is deteriorating, and delaying surgery could have fatal consequences.\n\nThe surgeon, who has examined the child and reviewed the x-ray, recommends an emergency laparotomy.

{"question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head on collision. The patient\u2019s echocardiogram (ECG) is notable only for sinus tachycardia. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patient\u2019s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall.

The patient's elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are consistent with cardiac injury. \n* **Hemorrhage (B)** is also possible, but the patient's stable vital signs and lack of signs of shock make it less likely. \n* **Pulmonary contusion (C)** is a lung injury, and while it can cause chest pain, it wouldn't typically elevate troponins or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. \n* **Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (D)** is a stress-induced cardiomyopathy, but it's usually triggered by emotional stress, not physical trauma.\n\nGiven the patient's history, physical exam, and lab findings, **cardiac contusion (A)** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThis patient needs to be seen by a **cardiologist** for further evaluation and management. \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncardiologist's Opinion:  \n  * **Mechanism of Injury:** The patient was in a head-on collision, which suggests a significant impact on the chest.\n  * **Symptoms:** Chest pain is a classic symptom of cardiac injury.\n  * **Elevated Troponins:** Troponins are cardiac enzymes released when heart muscle is damaged.

{"question": "A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F). On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers. Which of the following findings would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?Your options are: A: Bicuspid valve, B: Friable irregular masses attached to the valve, C: Papillary muscle rupture, D: Annular calcification.

{"question": "A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Your options are: A: Diaphragmatic rupture, B: Traumatic bronchial rupture, C: Thoracic aortic rupture, D: Tension pneumothorax.

{"question": "A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?Your options are: A: Autosomal dominant, B: Autosomal partial dominance, C: X-linked dominant, D: X-linked recessive. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "A", "society_answer": "1. The patient presents with classic symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE), including shortness of breath, chest pain exacerbated by breathing or coughing, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and a filling defect in the pulmonary vessels. \n 2. The initial treatment for PE is anticoagulation, which aims to prevent further clot formation and promote clot breakdown. \n 3. The fact that the blood test results returned within normal parameters despite the administration of anticoagulants suggests that the underlying cause of the PE might not be a typical clotting disorder. \n 4.  The patient's age and lack of previous medical history make certain genetic conditions more likely. \n 5.  Considering the presentation and the unexpected response to anticoagulation, a genetic predisposition to PE is a strong possibility. \n 6.

This analysis is purely hypothetical based on the information provided.\n\n**Specialist:** This case requires the expertise of a **pulmonologist** (lung specialist) and a **hematologist** (blood specialist) to investigate the cause of the PE and the unexpected test results. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nneurologist's Opinion:  \n 1. **The patient's presentation:** The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which are classic symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE). \n 2. **The imaging findings:** The presence of a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels further supports the diagnosis of PE.\n 3. **The treatment:** The prompt states that the patient was started on an appropriate treatment intravenously, which is consistent with the standard treatment for PE, which is anticoagulation therapy.\n 4. **The unexpected blood test results:** The blood test results coming back within normal parameters despite the treatment is unusual. This suggests that the underlying cause of the PE might be different from a typical clotting disorder.\n 5. **The question about inheritance:** The question asks about the inheritance pattern of the *underlying cause* of the PE. This implies that there might be a genetic predisposition to the patient's condition.\n 6. **Considering the inheritance patterns:**\n    * **Autosomal dominant:** A single copy of the mutated gene from one parent is enough to cause the disease.\n    * **Autosomal recessive:** Two copies of the mutated gene are needed to cause the disease.\n    * **X-linked dominant:** The mutated gene is on the X chromosome, and a single copy in females or males will cause the disease.\n    * **X-linked recessive:** The mutated gene is on the X chromosome, and males are more likely to be affected as they only have one X chromosome. Females need two copies of the mutated gene to be affected.\n\n7. **The most likely answer:** Given the patient's young age and lack of family history of clotting disorders, X-linked recessive is less likely.  Autosomal dominant inheritance is a strong possibility, as many clotting disorders, such as Factor V Leiden, follow this pattern.\n\n**Therefore, the most likely inheritance pattern in this scenario is autosomal dominant (A).**\n\n**Specialist:** This case requires the expertise of a **hematologist**.

{"question": "A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.

{"question": "A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. His wife states that he has been unable to recall his birthday or her name. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C 3 years ago but refused treatment. He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows scleral icterus and spider angiomas. There are fine tremors of the hands bilaterally. The abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding. Bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.6 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 13,900/mm3\nPlatelet count 342,000/mm3\nSerum\nAlbumin 2.6 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 2.56 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 54 U/L\nAST 17 U/L\nALT 44 U/L\nParacentesis is performed. Ascitic fluid analysis shows an albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL, glucose concentration of 62 mg/dL, and a leukocyte count of 1900/mm3 with 60% neutrophils.

{"question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?Your options are: A: Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck, B: Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy, C: Intravenous antibiotics, D: Trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "B", "society_answer": "B]", "problem_type": ["neurologist", "headdoctor"], "gyneacologist": "Your Opinion: \n This child presents with classic symptoms of croup, including a barking cough, stridor, hoarseness, and a history of a viral prodrome.

{"question": "An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient\u2019s symptoms?Your options are: A: Herniation of the uncus, B: Herniation of the cingulate gyrus, C: Occlusion of the basilar artery, D: Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery.

trauma:** The fall and head injury are significant.\n* **Neurological deficits:**  The patient exhibits disorientation, altered mental status, unequal pupils (left dilated and non-reactive), right-sided visual field defect, and right-sided hemiparesis. These findings point towards a focal neurological lesion.\n* **Cardiac history:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent palpitations raise the possibility of a stroke.\n\n**Considering the CT scan findings (which are not provided in your question), the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is herniation of the uncus (A).**\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Uncal herniation:** This occurs when the uncus (a part of the temporal lobe) is pushed down through the tentorial notch (a space in the skull). This can compress the oculomotor nerve (CN III), causing the dilated and non-reactive pupil on the same side as the herniation. It can also affect the brainstem, leading to altered consciousness and other neurological deficits.\n\n**Other options are less likely:**\n\n* **Cingulate gyrus herniation:** This type of herniation is less common and typically presents with different neurological signs.\n* **Basilar artery occlusion:** This would cause a \"locked-in\" syndrome with preserved consciousness but paralysis and sensory loss.\n* **Anterior spinal artery occlusion:** This would cause a specific pattern of weakness and sensory loss in the lower extremities.\n\n**Specialist:** This patient requires immediate attention from a **neurologist** or a **neurosurgeon**.

A neurologist specializes in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders and would be best equipped to interpret the CT findings and determine the appropriate management.\n\n**Answer: [Answer: A]** \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"question": "A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.

{"question": "A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient\u2019s presentation?Your options are: A: Decreased acetylcholine release, B: Overactivation of adenylate cyclase, C: Release of interferon-gamma, D: Inhibition of GABA release.

neurological issue, possibly affecting the autonomic nervous system and cranial nerves. Food poisoning is a strong possibility given the recent meal and the friend's similar symptoms.\n 4. **Analyze the options:**\n    * A: Decreased acetylcholine release - This could lead to mydriasis (dilated pupils) and other autonomic dysfunction, aligning with the patient's symptoms.\n    * B: Overactivation of adenylate cyclase - This is less likely to cause the specific neurological symptoms observed.\n    * C: Release of interferon-gamma - This is primarily involved in immune responses and not directly linked to the patient's presentation.\n    * D: Inhibition of GABA release - This could lead to seizures and other neurological issues, but not the specific symptoms described.\n\n**Specialist:** A **Neurologist** would be the most appropriate specialist to evaluate this patient. They can perform a thorough neurological examination, order necessary tests (e.g., lumbar puncture, imaging), and determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation strongly suggests a neurological disorder with possible food poisoning as a contributing factor.

{"question": "A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years.

{"question": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago while he was at a party. He has a history of major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies. His mother has a history of anxiety. He drinks 5 beers on the weekends. Current medications include amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. The patient does not respond to questions and repeatedly says, \"\"The government is following me everywhere.\"\" His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg. He is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to place or time. Neurologic examination shows dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds. After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide.

{"question": "A 51-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of months of dry mouth and dry eyes. She says the dryness has become so severe that she has difficulty swallowing food. She has a history of hypertension, for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but she has no other medical problems. Family history is significant for her grandmother having systemic lupus erythematosus. The vital signs include: blood pressure 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical exam, she has tender parotid glands bilaterally and dries mucous membranes. The presence of serum anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies is confirmed at high titers. In addition to her primary diagnosis, which of the following is this patient most at risk for developing in the future?Your options are: A: Gastric carcinoma, B: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, C: Invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, D: Adenocarcinoma of the lung.

{"question": "A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?Your options are: A: Using survival rates in the analysis, B: Using mortality rates in the analysis, C: Increasing the number of screened individuals, D: Decreasing the number of screened individuals.
