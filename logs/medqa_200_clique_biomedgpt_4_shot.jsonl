{"question": "A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks\u2019 gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient\u2019s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?Your options are: A: It is a Southwestern blot, identifying the presence of DNA-binding proteins, B: It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of RNA, C: It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of DNA, D: It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

{"question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a \u03b2-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen.

{"question": "A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?Your options are: A: Legionella pneumophila infection, B: Pneumocystis pneumonia, C: Histoplasma capsulatum infection, D: Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.

{"question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?Your options are: A: Intubate with mechanical ventilation, B: Perform needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, C: Perform bronchoscopy, D: Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone.

{"question": "A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

{"question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?Your options are: A: Gram stain positive CSF, B: Peripheral eosinophilia, C: Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, D: Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count.

{"question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back.

{"question": "A man is brought into the emergency department by the police department. The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically. His vitals are all within normal limits. He appears confused and has a slurred speech. On gait exam, the patient is ataxic and cannot stand without support for more than a few seconds. Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?Your options are: A: Ethanol, B: Naltrexone, C: Naloxone, D: Fomepizole.

{"question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Your options are: A: Femoropopliteal artery stenosis, B: Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein, C: Lumbar spinal stenosis, D: Aortoiliac artery stenosis\n\".

{"question": "A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?Your options are: A: Tardive dyskinesia, B: Acute dystonia, C: Pseudoparkinsonism, D: Palsy. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "A", "society_answer": "A].\nThe p", "problem_type": ["neurologist", "headdoctor"], "gyneacologist": "Your Opinion:First, we need to identify the patient's problem. The patient is a 61-year-old man with schizophrenia who has been treated with haloperidol for several months. He is now exhibiting unusual lip-smacking, pursing of the mouth, and blinking. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced.\nNext, we need to consider the differential diagnosis. The patient's symptoms could be due to tardive dyskinesia, acute dystonia, pseudoparkinsonism, or palsy.\nTardive dyskinesia is a long-term side effect of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, that can cause involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs. It typically develops after long-term use of antipsychotic medications and can be difficult to treat.\nAcute dystonia is a neurological disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions, leading to abnormal postures and movements. It can be triggered by certain medications, including antipsychotics, and can be treated with medications such as botulinum toxin injections.\nPseudoparkinsonism is a condition that mimics Parkinson's disease but does not involve the same underlying neurological changes. It can be caused by medications such as antipsychotics and can be treated with medications such as levodopa.\nPalsy is a condition that causes weakness or paralysis of a muscle or group of muscles. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including nerve damage, and can be treated with physical therapy and other interventions.\nBased on the information provided, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to tardive dyskinesia.

{"question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of pallor and increasing lethargy for 2 days. One week ago, he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that have since subsided. The patient's father states that they returned early from a 6-week roadtrip in Mexico because of these symptoms. His parents have been giving him oral rehydration solution. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears pale. His temperature is 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 35/min, and blood pressure is 95/50 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 8.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 94 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 45,000/mm3\nProthrombin time 12 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time 34 sec\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 28 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.6 mg/dL\nBilirubin\nTotal 2.5 mg/dL\nDirect 0.1 mg/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase 1658 U/L\nA blood smear shows schistocytes.

{"question": "A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her \u2018skinny friends\u2019. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient\u2019s condition?Your options are: A: Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed, B: Patients do not usually initiate treatment, C: Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia, D: Patients will typically have a BMI between 17\u201318.5 kg/m2.
