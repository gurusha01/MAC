{"question": "Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin count 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,400/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 56%\nEosinophils 11%\nLymphocytes 31%\nMonocytes 2%\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 4.2 mg/dL\nRenal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\"Your options are: A: Renal papillary necrosis, B: Cholesterol embolization, C: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, D: Polyarteritis nodosa.

{"question": "A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks\u2019 gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient\u2019s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?Your options are: A: It is a Southwestern blot, identifying the presence of DNA-binding proteins, B: It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of RNA, C: It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of DNA, D: It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

{"question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician\u2019s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a \u03b2-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?Your options are: A: IL-2, B: IL-10, C: IL-13, D: IL-4.

{"question": "A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?Your options are: A: 22q11 deletion, B: Deletion of genes on chromosome 7, C: Lithium exposure in utero, D: Maternal alcohol consumption.

{"question": "A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae.

{"question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?Your options are: A: Intubate with mechanical ventilation, B: Perform needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, C: Perform bronchoscopy, D: Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone.

{"question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?Your options are: A: Gram stain positive CSF, B: Peripheral eosinophilia, C: Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, D: Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count.

The inconclusive ultrasound and the cholescintigraphy findings further support this diagnosis.\n\n**The specialist who can help here is a Gastroenterologist.** They specialize in the digestive system and are experts in diagnosing and treating conditions like cholecystitis. \n\n[Answer: D] \n\n \n\n\ncardiologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nendocrinologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nYour Opinion: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n"}
{"question": "A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, intermittent rigors, and night sweats. She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci.

{"question": "A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair.

{"question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back.

{"question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Your options are: A: Femoropopliteal artery stenosis, B: Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein, C: Lumbar spinal stenosis, D: Aortoiliac artery stenosis\n\".

**Tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when raising it above chest level (intermittent claudication)** is a classic symptom of PAD. \n* **Calf cramps when using the incline feature on the treadmill** further supports this.\n* **Pain disappearing after resting** is consistent with PAD as blood flow improves with rest.\n* **Absent right pedal pulses** strongly indicate a blockage in the arteries supplying blood to the foot.\n\nWhile the other options could potentially cause some of the symptoms, they are less likely given the specific clinical presentation.\n\n* **Lumbar spinal stenosis** typically causes back pain and leg pain that radiates down the back of the leg, not primarily in the sole of the foot.\n* **Acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein** would cause swelling and pain in the calf, not primarily in the foot.\n* **Aortoiliac artery stenosis** is less likely to cause isolated symptoms in the right foot.\n\n**Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Femoropopliteal artery stenosis (A).**\n\n**Specialist:** This patient needs to be evaluated by a **vascular surgeon** or a **cardiologist specializing in vascular medicine**. They can perform further tests, such as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) and an ultrasound or angiogram, to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options. \n\n\n\n \n\n\noncologist's Opinion:  \n

 * **Lumbar spinal stenosis** typically causes back pain and leg pain that radiates down the back of the leg, not primarily in the sole of the foot.\n    * **Acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein** would cause swelling and pain in the calf, not primarily in the foot.\n    * **Aortoiliac artery stenosis** is less likely to cause isolated symptoms in the right foot.\n\n* **The patient's history of diabetes and smoking further supports PAD.**\n\n**Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Femoropopliteal artery stenosis (A).** \n\n\n\n**Specialist:** This patient needs to be evaluated by a **vascular surgeon** or a **cardiologist specializing in vascular medicine**. They can perform further tests, such as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) and an ultrasound or angiogram, to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options. \n\n\nIt seems like all the specialists agree that the most likely diagnosis is Femoropopliteal artery stenosis (A). \n\n[Answer: A] \n\n\n\n"}
{"question": "A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in labor. She has no history of serious medical illness. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Her last ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation was normal. On admission, fetal heartbeats cannot be detected by fetal doppler monitor. Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) male infant. Physical examination shows no signs of life. There are no visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?Your options are: A: Perform karyotyping of amniotic fluid, B: Recommend autopsy of the infant, C: Obtain photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI, D: Obtain consent for parental genetic testing.

{"question": "A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal.

{"question": "A 15-year-old woman presents with fever, altered mental status and a petechial rash on her lower extremities and back since yesterday evening. She also says she has been nauseous for the past 3 hours and has vomited twice. The patient mentions she has had heavy menstrual bleeding for the past few days. Her blood pressure is 95/80 mm Hg and her temperature is 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic. A pelvic examination reveals a tampon in her vagina.

{"question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of pallor and increasing lethargy for 2 days. One week ago, he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that have since subsided. The patient's father states that they returned early from a 6-week roadtrip in Mexico because of these symptoms. His parents have been giving him oral rehydration solution.

{"question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?Your options are: A: Get consent from the patient's brother, B: Get consent from the patient, C: Perform emergency laparotomy, D: Delay surgery until parental consent.

{"question": "A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?Your options are: A: Transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies, B: Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies, C: Transplacental viral infection, D: Opiate use in the mother.

{"question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase.

{"question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head on collision. The patient\u2019s echocardiogram (ECG) is notable only for sinus tachycardia. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patient\u2019s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Your options are: A: Cardiac contusion, B: Hemorrhage, C: Pulmonary contusion, D: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

This suggests significant trauma.\n* **Physical exam:** Bruising over the chest wall, consistent with blunt force trauma.\n* **Vital signs:** Tachycardia, slightly low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. These are consistent with initial shock but are improving with fluid resuscitation.\n* **ECG:** Sinus tachycardia, which is expected in this situation.\n* **Lab findings:** Elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Elevated troponins indicate myocardial injury, while elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests fluid overload, likely due to the initial fluid resuscitation.\n\n**Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac contusion (A).**\n\n**Specialist:** This patient requires immediate attention from a **cardiologist** to assess the extent of cardiac damage and guide further management. \n\n\n\n \n\n\ncardiologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

{"question": "A 62-year old female comes to the physician because of vaginal spotting and urinary urgency for the past 4 days. She has had no fever, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. Her last Pap smear 1 year ago was normal. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Medications include atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and aspirin. She is sexually active with her husband. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 155/65 mm Hg. Pelvic exam demonstrates a 4 x 3 cm firm, immobile erythematous mass on the right inner vaginal wall.

{"question": "A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history. Vitals show a temperature of 37-0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?Your options are: A: Immediate cardiac transplant, B: Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated, C: Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets, D: Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space.

{"question": "A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F).

{"question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?Your options are: A: Undercooked pork meat, B: Undercooked fish meat, C: Dog feces, D: Freshwater snails. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "D", "society_answer": "", "problem_type": ["gyneacologist", "headdoctor"], "gyneacologist": "Your Opinion: \n\nThe patient presents with symptoms suggestive of parasitic infection: loose stools, weight loss, abdominal tenderness, and an elevated eosinophil count. The stool culture revealing oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines points towards a specific parasite. \n\nThe liver biopsy findings of granulomatous inflammation and periportal fibrosis further support a parasitic etiology. \n\nConsidering the patient's recent immigration from Uganda, the most likely culprit is a parasite endemic to that region. \n\nOut of the given options, **D: Freshwater snails** are the most likely vector for a parasite causing these symptoms. \n\nThis patient's case strongly suggests schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease transmitted through contact with freshwater

stools, weight loss, abdominal tenderness, and an elevated eosinophil count. The stool culture revealing oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines points towards a specific parasite. \n\nThe liver biopsy findings of granulomatous inflammation and periportal fibrosis further support a parasitic etiology. \n\nConsidering the patient's recent immigration from Uganda, the most likely culprit is a parasite endemic to that region. \n\nOut of the given options, **D: Freshwater snails** are the most likely vector for a parasite causing these symptoms. \n\nThis patient's case strongly suggests schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease transmitted through contact with freshwater contaminated with schistosome larvae. \n\nTherefore, a **Gastroenterologist** or an **Infectious Disease Specialist** would be best suited to manage this patient's case. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\noncologist's

{"question": "A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl\u2019s condition?Your options are: A: The tricuspid valve is the most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot., B: Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia., C: Cerebral arterial thrombosis is more common than cerebral venous thrombosis., D: Refractory heart failure is a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot..

{"question": "A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient\u2019s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient\u2019s hands bilaterally.

{"question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest just below the clavicle. On arrival, he has rapid, shallow breathing and appears anxious. His pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Five minutes later, his pulse is 133/min and blood pressure is 82/45 mm Hg. Examination shows no active external bleeding. There is a 2.5-cm single stab wound to the left chest at the 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?Your options are: A: Tracheal deviation toward the right side, B: Hemoptysis, C: A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration, D: Paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing\n\".

{"question": "A 40-year-old man presents to his primary-care doctor for a follow-up of his hypertension. He is asymptomatic at his office visit and denies any new complaints. He has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. His past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition?Your options are: A: Colonoscopy, B: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, C: Liver function tests, D: MR angiography of the brain.

{"question": "A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?Your options are: A: Autosomal dominant, B: Autosomal partial dominance, C: X-linked dominant, D: X-linked recessive. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "A", "society_answer": "A]", "problem_type": ["oncologist", "cardiologist"], "gyneacologist": "Your Opinion: \n 1. **Symptoms:** The patient presents with shortness of breath, chest pain worsened by breathing or coughing, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and fever. These symptoms suggest a pulmonary issue, likely involving blood clots or inflammation.\n\n2. **Findings:** The large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels strongly points towards a pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage in the pulmonary arteries usually caused by a blood clot.\n\n3. **Treatment:** The intravenous treatment likely involves anticoagulants (blood thinners) to prevent further clot formation and dissolve existing clots.\n\n4. **Unexpected Test Results:** The normal blood test results despite the PE are unusual. This could indicate several possibilities:\n    * The drug might be working effectively, but the test is not sensitive enough to detect the change.\n    * The patient might have a rare condition affecting blood clotting or the test's accuracy.\n\n5. **Inheritance:**  The question asks about the inheritance pattern of the most likely underlying cause.

{"question": "A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?Your options are: A: CT chest without contrast in 24 months, B: Positive emission tomography (PET) of chest now, C: Right middle lobectomy now, D: Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now.

{"question": "A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. His wife states that he has been unable to recall his birthday or her name. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C 3 years ago but refused treatment. He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows scleral icterus and spider angiomas. There are fine tremors of the hands bilaterally. The abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding. Bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.6 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 13,900/mm3\nPlatelet count 342,000/mm3\nSerum\nAlbumin 2.6 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 2.56 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 54 U/L\nAST 17 U/L\nALT 44 U/L\nParacentesis is performed. Ascitic fluid analysis shows an albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL, glucose concentration of 62 mg/dL, and a leukocyte count of 1900/mm3 with 60% neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\"Your options are: A: Aseptic peritoneal inflammation, B: Neoplastic growth, C: Bacterial translocation, D: Perforated viscus. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "C", "society_answer": "C]", "problem_type": ["oncologist", "headdoctor"], "gyneacologist": "Your Opinion: \n The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of advanced liver disease, including jaundice (scleral icterus), ascites, encephalopathy (confusion, memory loss), and spider angiomas. His history of chronic hepatitis C, untreated for 3 years, and recurrent pancreatitis strongly points towards cirrhosis as the underlying cause. \n\nThe ascitic fluid analysis further supports this diagnosis. The low albumin concentration (0.8 g/dL) and elevated leukocyte count (1900/mm3) with a predominance of neutrophils are consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common complication of cirrhosis. \n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is **C: Bacterial translocation**.\n\nWhile the other options are possible, they are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings. \n\nThis patient requires immediate attention from a **Hepatologist** who specializes in liver diseases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\noncologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n

{"question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?Your options are: A: Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck, B: Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy, C: Intravenous antibiotics, D: Trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids. What do you think which specialist can help here?", "gold_answer": "B", "society_answer": "", "problem_type": ["neurologist", "headdoctor"], "gyneacologist": "Your Opinion: \n This child presents with classic symptoms of croup, including a barking cough, stridor, hoarseness, and a history of a viral prodrome.

{"question": "A 43-year-old woman presents with complaints of retrosternal burning associated with eating. It has persisted for the past several years but has been getting worse. Her past medical history is unknown and this is her first time seeing a doctor. She states she is otherwise healthy and review of systems is notable for episodic hand pain that is worse in the winter as well as a chronic and severe cough with dyspnea which she attributes to her smoking. Her temperature is 97.7\u00b0F (36.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 174/104 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a young appearing woman with coarse breath sounds. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are ordered and currently pending.

{"question": "A 16-year-old boy with a seizure disorder and cognitive delay is brought to the physician because of progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness for the past 6 months. He does not make eye contact and sits very close to his mother. Physical examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?Your options are: A: NF1 gene on chromosome 17, B: NF2 gene on chromosome 22, C: TSC1 gene on chromosome 9, D: VHL gene on chromosome 3.

{"question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value.

{"question": "An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient\u2019s symptoms?Your options are: A: Herniation of the uncus, B: Herniation of the cingulate gyrus, C: Occlusion of the basilar artery, D: Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery.

disorientation, altered mental status, unequal pupils (left dilated and non-reactive), right-sided visual field defect, and right-sided hemiparesis. These findings point towards a focal neurological lesion.\n    * **Cardiac history:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent palpitations raise the possibility of a stroke.\n\n* **Considering the CT scan findings (which are not provided in your question), the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is herniation of the uncus (A).**\n\n* **Here's why:**\n    * **Uncal herniation:** This occurs when the uncus (a part of the temporal lobe) is pushed down through the tentorial notch (a space in the skull). This can compress the oculomotor nerve (CN III), causing the dilated and non-reactive pupil on the same side as the herniation. It can also affect the brainstem, leading to altered consciousness and other neurological deficits.\n\n* **Other options are less likely:**\n    * **Cingulate gyrus herniation:** This type of herniation is less common and typically presents with different neurological signs.\n    * **Basilar artery occlusion:** This would cause a \"locked-in\" syndrome with preserved consciousness but paralysis and sensory loss.\n    * **Anterior spinal artery occlusion:** This would cause a specific pattern of weakness and sensory loss in the lower extremities.\n\n* **Specialist:** This patient requires immediate attention from a **neurologist** or a **neurosurgeon**. They will be able to interpret the CT scan findings, diagnose the specific type of herniation, and initiate appropriate treatment.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYour Opinion: \n 1. **The patient's symptoms are neurological:**  Disorientation, unequal pupils, visual field defect, and hemiparesis strongly suggest a problem with the brain.\n 2. **The history of head trauma is crucial:** This points towards a possible traumatic brain injury.\n 3. **The description of the pupils is key:** The dilated and non-reactive pupil on the left side is a classic sign of uncal herniation. This occurs when the uncus of the temporal lobe pushes down on the oculomotor nerve (CN III).\n\n**Therefore, the most likely explanation is herniation of the uncus (A).** \n\n\n[Answer: A] \n\n\n\n"}
{"question": "A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.

{"question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.7 g/dL\nLeukocytes 11,200/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h\nSerum\nCreatine kinase 212 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L\nAST 34 U/L\nALT 35 U/L\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"Your options are: A: Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy, B: Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy, C: Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, D: Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis.

{"question": "A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal.

{"question": "A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever with chills and pain in her knee and ankle joints for the past 2 days. She also complains of headaches and difficulty moving her neck. Further questioning reveals that she had a tick bite on her arm while gardening a few days ago. Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease.

{"question": "A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?Your options are: A: Pelvic ultrasound, B: Measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels, C: Reassurance and follow-up, D: MRI of the brain.

{"question": "A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months. Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

{"question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for a rash on his trunk, which he has had for the past 2 days. She notes that he is eating less and is more cranky than usual. His birth history is insignificant, and his immunizations are up to date. Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?Your options are: A: Immunoglobulin- IgG, B: Immunoglobulin- IgD, C: Immunoglobulin- IgA, D: Immunoglobulin- IgM.

{"question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with dry cough, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever that began 6 days ago. He also reports that he has had 3 episodes of watery diarrhea per day for the last 2 days. He appears slightly pale. His temperature is 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 140/78 mm Hg. Diffuse crackles are heard over bibasilar lung fields.

with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia (cough, shortness of breath, fever, crackles on auscultation, patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray) and possible gastroenteritis (diarrhea). \n\nThe elevated white blood cell count (16,000/mm3) supports the diagnosis of infection. \n\nThe electrolyte panel shows mild metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), which can be associated with pneumonia.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is likely an antibiotic. \n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n* **A: Levofloxacin:** A broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against many respiratory pathogens. \n* **B: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole:** A broad-spectrum antibiotic often used for community-acquired pneumonia, but resistance is increasing.\n* **C: Amoxicillin:** A penicillin antibiotic effective against some respiratory pathogens but may not be sufficient for community-acquired pneumonia.\n* **D: Rifampin:** Primarily used for tuberculosis and not typically the first-line choice for pneumonia.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and the need for broad-spectrum coverage, **Levofloxacin (A)** is the most

presents with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia (cough, shortness of breath, fever, crackles on auscultation, patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray) and possible gastroenteritis (diarrhea). \n\nThe elevated white blood cell count (16,000/mm3) supports the diagnosis of infection. \n\nThe electrolyte panel shows mild metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), which can be associated with pneumonia.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is likely an antibiotic. \n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n* **A: Levofloxacin:** A broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against many respiratory pathogens. \n* **B: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole:** A broad-spectrum antibiotic often used for community-acquired pneumonia, but resistance is increasing.\n* **C: Amoxicillin:** A penicillin antibiotic effective against some respiratory pathogens but may not be sufficient for community-acquired pneumonia.\n* **D: Rifampin:** Primarily used for tuberculosis and not typically the first-line choice for pneumonia.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and the need for broad-spectrum coverage, **Levofloxacin (A)** is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.\n\nThis patient needs to be seen by a **Pulmonologist** or an **Infectious Disease Specialist** for further evaluation and management. \n\n\n\n

{"question": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago while he was at a party. He has a history of major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies. His mother has a history of anxiety. He drinks 5 beers on the weekends. Current medications include amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. The patient does not respond to questions and repeatedly says, \"\"The government is following me everywhere.\"\" His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg. He is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to place or time. Neurologic examination shows dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds. After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide.

His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. He speaks in full sentences and is oriented to person, place, and time. The patient\u2019s neck is flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices.

{"question": "A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:\nNa+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.2 mEq/L\nCl- 102 mEq/L\nHCO3- 25 mEq/L\nMg2+ 1.7 mEq/L\nPhosphorus 4.3 mg/dL\n25-hydroxyvitamin D 20 ng/mL (N: 20-100 ng/mL)\nParathyroid hormone 115 pg/mL\nTotal bilirubin, serum 0.7 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase, serum 14 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?\"Your options are: A: Obtain abdominal CT, B: Begin rehydration therapy, C: Administer calcium gluconate, D: Supplementation with vitamin D.

{"question": "A 5-year-old boy of African descent is presented to the emergency department by his parents. The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient\u2019s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

{"question": "A 51-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of months of dry mouth and dry eyes. She says the dryness has become so severe that she has difficulty swallowing food. She has a history of hypertension, for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but she has no other medical problems. Family history is significant for her grandmother having systemic lupus erythematosus. The vital signs include: blood pressure 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respiratory rate 15/min.

{"question": "A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?Your options are: A: Using survival rates in the analysis, B: Using mortality rates in the analysis, C: Increasing the number of screened individuals, D: Decreasing the number of screened individuals.

This could lead to an overestimation of the screening benefit.\n\n3. **Solution:** To prevent this bias, we need to account for the potential differences between screened and unscreened individuals.\n\n4. **Why the Answer is B:** Using mortality rates instead of survival rates helps address this bias.

These complexes deposit in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage, resulting in hematuria, proteinuria, and edema.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism involved is the formation of antigen-antibody complexes.\n\n[Answer: C]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nneurologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\ncardiologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nendocrinologist's Opinion:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n", "neurologist": "gyneacologist's Opinion:  \n\nThe patient presents with hematuria, edema, and proteinuria following a sore throat.
