# here we define a society of mathematicians that work together to solve problems from math dataset. 
# First there is a decomposer that decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems and distributes them to the mathematicians. 
# Then there are mathemaricians that specialize in different feilds like algebra, calculus, geometry, etc. 
# they work with other math researchers that are further specialized in different areas like number area calculation, counting principal,etc.
# after conversation, they report their answers to an aggregator that aggregates the answers and returns the final answer.
# Currently we start with MATH dataset, then we include HardMAth, Scibench etc as well.
