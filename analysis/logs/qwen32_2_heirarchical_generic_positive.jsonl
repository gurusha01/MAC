Since \\(9 = 3^2\\), a factorial \\(n!\\) is divisible by 9 if it includes at least two factors of 3.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Count the multiples of 3 up to 100**: Every third number is a multiple of 3. So, the count of multiples of 3 up to 100 is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 33\\).\n\n2. **Count the multiples of 9 up to 100**: Every ninth number is a multiple of 9. So, the count of multiples of 9 up to 100 is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 11\\).\n\n3. **Count the multiples of 27 up to 100**: Every 27th number is a multiple of 27. So, the count of multiples of 27 up to 100 is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27} \\right\\rfloor = 3\\).\n\n4. **Count the multiples of 81 up to 100**: Every 81st number is a multiple of 81. So, the count of multiples of 81 up to 100 is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 1\\).\n\nEach multiple of 3 contributes at least one factor of 3, each multiple of 9 contributes an additional factor of 3 (making it two factors of 3 in total), each multiple of 27 contributes yet another factor of 3 (making it three factors of 3 in total), and each multiple of 81 contributes yet another factor of 3 (making it four factors of 3 in total).\n\nHowever, to determine when a factorial \\(n!\\) is divisible by 9, we need to ensure that it has at least two factors of 3. This happens starting from \\(6!\\) because:\n- \\(6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\\), which includes two factors of 3 (from 3 and 6).\n\nThus, every factorial from \\(6!\\) to \\(100!\\) will have at least two factors of 3 and thus be divisible by 9. Therefore, the number of factorials from \\(1!\\) to \\(100!\\) that are divisible by 9 is \\(100 - 5 = 95\\). We subtract 5 because \\(1!\\) to \\(5!\\) do not have two factors of 3.\n\n[Answer: 95] \n\n\n"}
