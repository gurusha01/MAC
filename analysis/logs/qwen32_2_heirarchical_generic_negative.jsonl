As \\( x \\) increases, \\( ax^2 + bx \\) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( [0, \\infty) \\).\n- If \\( a = 0 \\), \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{bx} \\) and the range is also \\( [0, \\infty) \\).\n- If \\( a < 0 \\), the maximum value of \\( ax^2 + bx \\) on the domain \\( [0, -\\frac{b}{a}] \\) is at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) (vertex of the parabola).
