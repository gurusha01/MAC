Setting this equal to \\( 48 + 49i \\) gives \\( k = 24 \\), so \\( n = 97 \\).[Answer: 97] \n\n\ncalculus's Opinion: To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \\( n \\) such that the sum \\( S = i + 2i^2 + 3i^3 + \\cdots + ni^n = 48 + 49i \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall the powers of \\( i \\):\n\\[\ni^1 = i, \\quad i^2 = -1, \\quad i^3 = -i, \\quad i^4 = 1, \\quad i^5 = i, \\quad \\text{and so on.}\n\\]\nThe powers of \\( i \\) repeat every 4 terms. Therefore, we can group the terms in the sum \\( S \\) into groups of 4:\n\\[\nS = (i + 2i^2 + 3i^3 + 4i^4) + (5i^5 + 6i^6 + 7i^7 + 8i^8) + \\cdots + \\text{remaining terms}.\n\\]\nEach group of 4 terms sums to:\n\\[\ni + 2(-1) + 3(-i) + 4(1) = i - 2 - 3i + 4 = 2 - 2i.\n\\]\nLet's denote the number of complete groups of 4 terms by \\( k \\). Then the sum of these \\( k \\) groups is:\n\\[\nk(2 - 2i).\n\\]\nWe need to consider the remaining terms after these complete groups. If \\( n = 4k + r \\) where \\( r \\) is the remainder when \\( n \\) is divided by 4 (so \\( r \\) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3), the remaining terms are:\n\\[\n(4k+1)i + (4k+2)i^2 + (4k+3)i^3 + (4k+4)i^4 + \\cdots + ni^n.\n\\]\nIf \\( r = 0 \\), there are no remaining terms. If \\( r = 1 \\), the remaining term is \\( (4k+1)i \\). If \\( r = 2 \\), the remaining terms are \\( (4k+1)i + (4k+2)i^2 \\). If \\( r = 3 \\), the remaining terms are \\( (4k+1)i + (4k+2)i^2 + (4k+3)i^3 \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( n \\) such that the sum equals \\( 48 + 49i \\). Let's check the cases for \\( r \\):\n\n1. If \\( r = 0 \\), the sum is \\( k(2 - 2i) \\), which cannot be \\( 48 + 49i \\) because the imaginary part is a multiple of -2.\n2. If \\( r = 1 \\), the sum is \\( k(2 - 2i) + (4k+1)i = 2k + (4k+1-2k)i = 2k + (2k+1)i \\). Setting this equal to \\( 48 + 49i \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   2k = 48 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2k + 1 = 49.\n   \\]\n   Solving these, we get \\( k = 24 \\) and \\( n = 4k + 1 = 97 \\).\n\n3. If \\( r = 2 \\), the sum is \\( k(2 - 2i) + (4k+1)i + (4k+2)i^2 = 2k + (4k+1-2k-2)i = 2k + (2k-1)i \\). This cannot be \\( 48 + 49i \\) because the imaginary part is a multiple of 1.\n4. If \\( r = 3 \\), the sum is \\( k(2 - 2i) + (4k+1)i + (4k+2)i^2 + (4k+3)i^3 = 2k + (4k+1-2k-2-3)i = 2k + (2k-4)i \\). This cannot be \\( 48 + 49i \\) because the imaginary part is a multiple of -4.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\( n = 97 \\).\n\n<reason>The sum \\( i + 2i^2 + 3i^3 + \\cdots + ni^n \\) can be broken into groups of 4 terms, each summing to \\( 2 - 2i \\). For \\( n = 97 \\), the sum of 24 complete groups plus the remaining term \\( 97i \\) equals \\( 48 + 49i.[Answer: 97]\\reason> \n\n\n"}
