So, an eigenvector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWe normalize these eigenvectors to form an orthogonal matrix \\( P \\):\n\\[ P = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThe transformation \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = P \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix} \\) diagonalizes the quadratic form:\n\\[ x^2 + 8xy + 7y^2 = 9u^2 - v^2 = 225 \\]\n\nThe shortest distance from the origin to the hyperbola occurs when \\( u = 0 \\) and \\( v \\) is minimized. However, since \\( 9u^2 - v^2 = 225 \\), the minimum value of \\( |v| \\) is when \\( u = 0 \\), giving \\( v^2 = -225 \\), which is not possible. Instead, we consider the closest point on the hyperbola to the origin, which occurs when \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are such that the distance is minimized.\n\nThe distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Using the transformation, we have:\n\\[ x = \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{2v}{\\sqrt{5}}, \\quad y = \\frac{2u}{\\sqrt{5}} - \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = \\left( \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{2v}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{2u}{\\sqrt{5}} - \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5}(u^2 + 4uv + 4v^2 + 4u^2 - 4uv + v^2) = \\frac{1}{5}(5u^2 + 5v^2) = u^2 + v^2 \\]\n\nGiven \\( 9u^2 - v^2 = 225 \\), we solve for \\( u^2 + v^2 \\) by minimizing it. Let \\( u^2 = a \\) and \\( v^2 = b \\), then \\( 9a - b = 225 \\) and we want to minimize \\( a + b \\).\n\nFrom \\( 9a - b = 225 \\), we get \\( b = 9a - 225 \\). Substituting into \\( a + b \\):\n\\[ a + b = a + 9a - 225 = 10a - 225 \\]\nTo minimize \\( 10a - 225 \\), we need the smallest possible \\( a \\) such that \\( b \\geq 0 \\). So, \\( 9a - 225 \\geq 0 \\) or \\( a \\geq 25 \\).\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\( a + b \\) is when \\( a = 25 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), giving \\( a + b = 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the origin to the hyperbola is \\( \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\).\n\n[Answer: 5] \n\n\n"}

For \\( \\lambda_1 = 9 \\):\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1-9 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 7-9 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 & 4 \\\\ 4 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nThis gives us the equation \\( -8x + 4y = 0 \\) or \\( y = 2x \\). So, an eigenvector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nFor \\( \\lambda_2 = -1 \\):\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1+1 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 7+1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nThis gives us the equation \\( 2x + 4y = 0 \\) or \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2}x \\). So, an eigenvector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWe normalize these eigenvectors to form an orthogonal matrix \\( P \\):\n\\[ P = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThe transformation \\( \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = P \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix} \\) diagonalizes the quadratic form:\n\\[ x^2 + 8xy + 7y^2 = 9u^2 - v^2 = 225 \\]\n\nThe shortest distance from the origin to the hyperbola occurs when \\( u = 0 \\) and \\( v \\) is minimized. However, since \\( 9u^2 - v^2 = 225 \\), the minimum value of \\( |v| \\) is when \\( u = 0 \\), giving \\( v^2 = -225 \\), which is not possible. Instead, we consider the closest point on the hyperbola to the origin, which occurs when \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are such that the distance \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) is minimized.\n\nThe distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Using the transformation, we have:\n\\[ x = \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{2v}{\\sqrt{5}}, \\quad y = \\frac{2u}{\\sqrt{5}} - \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = \\left( \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{2v}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{2u}{\\sqrt{5}} - \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{5}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{5}(u^2 + 4uv + 4v^2 + 4u^2 - 4uv + v^2) = \\frac{1}{5}(5u^2 + 5v^2) = u^2 + v^2 \\]\n\nGiven \\( 9u^2 - v^2 = 225 \\), we solve for \\( u^2 + v^2 \\) by minimizing it. Let \\( u^2 = a \\) and \\( v^2 = b \\), then \\( 9a - b = 225 \\) and we want to minimize \\( a + b \\).\n\nFrom \\( 9a - b = 225 \\), we get \\( b = 9a - 225 \\). Substituting into \\( a + b \\):\n\\[ a + b = a + 9a - 225 = 10a - 225 \\]\nTo minimize \\( 10a - 225 \\), we need the smallest possible \\( a \\) such that \\( b \\geq 0 \\). So, \\( 9a - 225 \\geq 0 \\) or \\( a \\geq 25 \\).\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\( a + b \\) is when \\( a = 25 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), giving \\( a + b = 25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the origin to the hyperbola is \\( \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\).\n\n[Answer: 5] \n\n\n"}
